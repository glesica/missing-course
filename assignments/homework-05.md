# Homework 5

For this assignment, you will create a Makefile to process a set of text files
efficiently. The files can be found in [homework-05.zip](homework-05.zip).
Extract them to a directory and create a Makefile that transforms them in some
way. You should have two "phony" targets:

  1. `all` - the default target, should kick off your transformation
  2. `clean` - should delete the files created by your transformation

Presumably, you will have one or more additional targets to actually transform
the files.

I don't care how you transform the files, be creative! Maybe turn them into
HTML, or count how many words are in each, or convert their contents to all
upper-case.

You should explain what your transformation does in a comment at the top of the
Makefile.

Once you're finished, create a zip file that contains the input files along with
your Makefile (do not include the output files, run your `clean` target before
zipping). Submit the zip archive through Moodle.

The due date for this assignment is on Moodle.
