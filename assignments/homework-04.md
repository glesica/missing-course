# Homework 4

Download [homework-04.py](homework-04.py) and run it with a profiler (I suggest
using either cProfile or Scalene since we looked at those in class). Submit a
copy of the profiler output through Moodle **as well as** an explanation of the
results. What did the profiler tell you about the code? Which functions or lines
might be good candidates for optimization?

Submit the assignment through Moodle.
