**Proof that 1=2**  
I always thought this was interesting.
1) a = b  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--> Premise
2) a<sup>2</sup> = ab  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--> The equality is still true if you multiply both sides by the same amount
3) a<sup>2</sup> - b<sup>2</sup> = ab - b<sup>2</sup>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--> The equality is still true if you subtract the smae amount from both sides
4) (a + b)(a - b) = b(a - b)  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--> Just factoring each side doesn't change the amount on each side
5) a + b = b  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--> The equality is still true if you divide both sides by the same amount, that is, "canceling" (a-b)
6) a + a = a  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--> true by substitution since a=b.  Obviously here is where we see we went off the rails...
7) 2a = a  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--> Definition of multiplication
8) 2 = 1  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--> "cancel" a

<a href="https://www.math.toronto.edu/mathnet/falseProofs/first1eq2.html"> Here</a> is a trickier version with explanation.  In this case, we are dividing by zero in after step 4, since (a-b) = 0 if a = b.
