# Containers

  - [Linux Containers](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/containers/whats-a-linux-container)
  - [Docker](https://www.docker.com)
  - [Podman](https://podman.io)

Containers are all the rage lately, and perhaps for good reason. A container is
similar to a virtual machine in that it provides an isolated environment in
which one or more applications may be run. Unlike a virtual machine, however,
programs run natively inside of a container, no machine emulation is required.

Two popular container runtimes are [Docker](https://www.docker.com) and
[Podman](https://podman.io). These provide a UI layer over the top of
capabilities provided by the Linux kernel.

Containers have a variety of use-cases, we will discuss a couple of them in
class and look at some examples.
