Continuous integration (CI) is, strictly speaking, the practice of bringing code
changes together into a unified whole, well, continuously (or at least
frequently).

In practice, this means that any number of tasks are run automatically in order
to ensure that the code remains in a workable state as changes occur. There are
a number of modern systems that facilitate this sort of pattern, including
[GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions), which we will use in
class.

## Tasks

We will discuss several examples that might be part of a CI pipeline, listed
below.

  - Build
  - Unit tests
  - Static analysis
  - Performance audit
  - Deploy
  - Packaging
